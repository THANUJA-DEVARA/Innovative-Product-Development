EXISTING SYSTEM
-Traditional monitoring methods can not collect forest fire video information in real time and effectively. 
-In previous days we recognize the forest fire by the images. 
-If there is fire then they will clarify that there is a forest fire. 
-There is no other resources for recognizing it. This is less efficiency compared to the proposed system.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
-The proposed system aims to develop an efficient, automated method for detecting forest fires using video images captured by the Unmanned Aerial Vechiles (UAVs). 
-The system integrates real-time video analysis, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms to accurately identify signs of forest fires.
-The eight-rotor aircraft is driven by eight independent motors in which the adjacent motors rotate in the opposite direction. 
-The aircraft can control six freedom degrees of aircraft by controlling the rotational speed of eight rotors. 
-This video is turned into the images and the images converted into the frames. 
-In addition, there are influential factors such as foggy captured during morning.
